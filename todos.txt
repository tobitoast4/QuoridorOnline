- getGameDataAsync auch gleichzeitig als heartbeat nutzen (??) (-> wenn spieler lange nicht mehr darauf queried, ist dieser vmtl offline)
- improve page "play on this pc" (let the server still compute the errors,
                                  make screen for amount player selection before game starts
                                  (also for changing names))
- Button for place walls on mobile devices
- Zoom in out

- Save in files what is stored in memory LobbyManager (current idea: save each game in one json file)
  -> this makes multiple workers more easy
- Use web sockets
- Fix bug of overlapping players when players are placed initially (for >= 3 players,
  two players can place their pawn on the same field)
- enhance Game Over overlay -> add X button + add play again button
  (think of how to do the play again (lobby owner can start game again? players should vote to start a new game?
  -> probably implement the web sockets first))
