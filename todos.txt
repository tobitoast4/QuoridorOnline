- getGameDataAsync auch gleichzeitig als heartbeat nutzen (??) (-> wenn spieler lange nicht mehr darauf queried, ist dieser vmtl offline)

Play on this pc
- let the server compute the errors ??? -> to save resources: no,
- make screen for amount player selection before game starts
- implement the settings, the new style (green bg, ...) and the logic (e.g. diagonal jumps etc.)

User login
- Show history of games (this does not require user login actually)
- Login functionality
- Scoreboards with ranking (modes should be 2v2 and 4v4 (no 3v3!); maybe also different modes based on the time)
- Implement stats (win rate, most common opponent, ...)

Web sockets
- Use web sockets
- Time limit for players turn
- Implement something to show if player disconnected
- Add chat functionality

Error messages
- Fix bug with message 'lobby_as_dict .....' (or hide it; it has no bad influence on the game)
  'cannot access local variable 'lobby_as_dict' where it is not associated with a value'
- Reduce error message 'its not your turn'
- change error message 'This wall can not be placed (col_start=4.5, row_start=4, col_end=4.5, row_end=5) as it is overlapping with another wall'

Colors
- Make color (of player) changeable
- Save color of user in session (and reuse it in other games)
- Show color of user in lobby (to avoid same colors); maybe find algorithm to determine 'color distance' so that the color of to players can not be almost the same

Other important!! things:
- When viewing previous rounds in the game, it is currently unclear whose turn it was
(- Add an AI player)
- Thread to remove empty lobby (lobbies where no game was started) files
- Server should not delete game data files, when redeploying (maybe use a path outside of the project directory's folder)
- Put secret app key in env variable
- Think of donation (before adding advertisement
